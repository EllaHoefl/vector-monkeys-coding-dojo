    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <p>
      <b>The Vector Monkeys Coding Dojo was formed to provide people of all genders, backgrounds and 
      preferences the chance to become Software Engineers.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This means a few things to us that might not be immediately obvious:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Minimal prior knowledge required.</b> We start at the basics as far as reasonably 
          possible. A basic understanding of maths, basic computer usage and a certain fluidity in
          English is all we want to require.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Minimal financial burdens.</b> We feel strongly about the difference socioeconomic 
          background has on the likely paths that we, individually, can take. We do not charge for
          any part of the course program, and do not use any material, software or licence that
          requires purchase. That being said, we do require a working computer, an internet
          connection and a workable audio setup for remote conferencing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Focus on job relevant skills.</b> We welcome anyone who is interested in learning how
          to write a computer program, aiming to become a Software Engineer is strictly not 
          required. That being said, a part of our courses and events focus on the interviewing
          process, tools and strategies used by Software Enginners, and on collaborating in a team.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>What we offer</h2>
    <p>
      The Dojo aims to create and foster a community of people interested in coding, and to give them
      ongoing opportunities to deepen their knowledge and their skills. There are four major parts
      to this.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Weekly small-group courses.</b> The heart of the project is a 3 month long, weekly 2 hour
        course with accompanying exercises, held remotely in a small-group format (~5 people). Aim
        of the course is to bring complete beginners to a point where they are comfortable writing
        small React apps. The course focuses on the frontend side of things, mostly since there is 
        more immediate feedback. During the 3 months, students will get familiarity with
        <ul>
          <li>webdesign with HTML5, CSS3</li>
          <li>JavaScript and to some extend TypeScript</li>
          <li>Linux and potentially WSL</li>
          <li>Node.js, npm</li>
          <li>React, Redux, jest, react-static</li>
          <li>git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, eslint</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Weekly "deep-dives".</b> We also offer weekly, approx. one-hour long presentations on
        specific programming related topics, often but not always focused on web technologies. These
        are intended to maintain interest and learning, and to offer a place for discussions on
        technologies and current events. Deep dives are always remote, typically in Discord.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Monthly team coding sessions.</b> Understanding small examples is very different from
        being able to reason through and contribute to actual complex code bases. To help with the
        latter, the Vector Monkeys Coding Dojo holds ~12 hour session one weekend a month where we
        work on some reasonably complex project, including task management (we use Trello), design
        documents, story maps, code reviews and collaboration sessions. The current project is a
        Phaser.js pixel art game, targeted for web and mobile platforms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Resource collection.</b> There are lots of great coursewares, programming challenges and
        tutorials online and freely available already. As such, we don't have a huge collection of
        material that is specific to us. What we do try to provide is a first guide on how to start
        your journey. That includes a set of instructions for getting to a sensible starting point
        in terms of configuration and software for writing code, a basic set of tutorials on the
        basics of JavaScript, and a set of story-driven programming challenges that go hand in hand
        with the tutorials.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We also try to bring people interested in becoming Software Engineers together with people
      who are interested in hiring Software Engineers. And we have a Discord channel.
    </p>

    <h2>How we think about learning</h2>
    <p>
      We believe that, in order to improve a skill, the most relevant quality is <b>consistency</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To that end, we care about providing interesting challenges and examples and keeping students
      motivated. As such, we aim for
      <ul>
        <li>tasks with visual feedback,</li>
        <li>community engagement,</li>
        <li>story lines over encapsulated problems,</li>
        <li>incremental difficulty increases and</li>
        <li>continuous engagement.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
